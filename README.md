# 👋 Hi, I’m Sven — I build human-centered AI systems

PhD researcher at **TU Darmstadt** working on the boundary between **HCI and AI**, where people and intelligent systems meet.
I care about explainability, multimodal interaction, and making the emerging **Agentic Web** more usable and more transparent.

I grew up as the “family tech translator,” so a lot of my work is still about bridging gaps between people and machines — making complex systems feel understandable and approachable.

## 🧪 Research Interests

* **Human-Centered AI & Explainability**
  Helping people understand how AI models interpret images, actions, and context.
* **Multimodal Interaction**
  Combining language, direct manipulation, and visual context for natural AI interaction.
* **Agentic Web Interfaces**
  Building web-native affordances for agents through declarative HTML (VOIX).
* **Conversational Agents & Social Robots**
  Designing consistent, domain-aligned assistants across robots, browsers, and mobile.
